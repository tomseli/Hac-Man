%introduction
\section{Introduction} \label{ch:Introduction}
The objective of this design document is to present the design choices for the creation of Pac-Man, along with their respective justifications. The decision to implement Pac-man is based on on the expected freedom the game offers in its implementation. Furthermore, Pac-Man will allow us to implement some of the optional requirements in addition to the minimum requirements. Additionally, some variations on the fundemental gameplay are introduced to make the game more unique.


% \begin{itemize}
%   \item [\textbf{Player}]
% \end{itemize}

\section{Variations on the base game} \label{ch:twist}
In order to introduce a new learning opportunity and make the game more unique, a player adversary will be introduced. This will introduce, a co-op type, multiplayer aspect to the game. This feature will introduce a second set of player inputs which allows the control of one of the ghosts.


\section{Data types} \label{ch:dataTypes}
%ghost and player

The first thing to implement are models for the player and the ghosts. These objects need to move, and store some information about them. 

Movable objects in the game are called entities. These entities have a direction in which they are moving, a speed and a current position. These three data types are wrapped together in a record called movement. Furthermore, an entity can be alive or dead. 

Then, we can create a data type for the player and the ghosts. A player gets lives, next to being an entity. And the ghosts get some identifiers for it's name and it's current behaviour. Lastly, a data type got created for an optional local MultiPlayer feature, where a second player can control one of the ghosts.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Haskell]
  data isAlive = Alive | Dead

  data Direction = Left | Right | Up | Down
  
  type EntityPosition = (Float, Float)
  
  data Movement {
    direction :: Direction,
    speed :: Int,
    position :: EntityPosition
  }

  data Entity {
    movement :: Movement,
    alive :: isAlive
  }

  data GhostType = Inky 
                 | Pinky 
                 | Blinky 
                 | Clyde 
  
  data BehaviourMode = Chase | Scatter | Frightened | Home
  type Lives = Int

  data Player = {
    entity :: Entity
    lives :: Lives
  }

  data Ghost = {
    entity :: Entity,
    ghostName :: GhostType
    behaviourMode :: Behaviour
  }

  data PlayerGhost = {
    entity :: Entity
    ghostName :: GhostType
  }
\end{lstlisting}

% levels
\noindent The maze consists of two type of tiles, where each tile is an x by x square in a grid. The tile can be either a floor or a wall where each floor can be either one of the consumbles or an empty floor. The walls can be either a corner or a straight wall, each with their own orientation. This will be implemented as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Haskell]
  -- consider making sure this number is always non-negative
  type Level = Int

  data CornerOrientation = SE | NW | NE | SW
  data WallOrientation   = Horizontal | Vertical
  
  data WallShape  = Corner CornerOrientation
                  | Wall WallOrientation 

  data ConsumableType = Pellet | SuperPellet | Cherry

  data FloorType = Consumable ConsumableType | EmptyTile
  data Tile = Floor FloorType | Wall WallShape
\end{lstlisting}


The maze will utilise a Map structure in order to speed up execution. This would result in a reduction in the scaling from $O(n)$ to $O(logn)$ for tile lookup. As the program is expected to lookup a tile every time one has to check for collision, it is crucial that this takes as little time as possible. This is only possible if the key, which is the x and y coordinates of the tile, can be ordered. The instance below is an example but is important to show that the keys are indeed orderable. In this case it is possible using the implementation below. Thus, two tiles in the maze might look like: [((1, 0), Floor (Consumable Pellet)), ((2, 0), Wall (Corner SE))]. 

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Haskell]
  type TilePosition = (Int, Int) -- (x, y)

  type Maze = Map TilePosition Tile

  instance Ord TilePosition where 
    (<=) (x, y) (a, b) | x < a = True 
                       | x > a = False
                       | Otherwise = y <= b

\end{lstlisting}

\newpage
%gamestate
The game state is the final data type the contains all the data of the game. It's job is to be the model in the MVC structure. 

Some data types that have been added here, but not discussed before are some scorekeepers, like elapsedTime and score. Furthermore, the current
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Haskell]
  data GameStatus = Running | GameOver | Paused
  data PlayerMode = SingePlayer | MultiPlayer
  type Score = Int

  data GameState = Gamestate{
    elapsedTime :: Float,
    score :: Score,
    status :: GameStatus,
    playerMode :: PlayerMode,
    maze :: Maze, 
    level :: Level,
    player :: Player,
    ghosts :: [Ghost],
    secondPlayer :: Maybe PlayerGhost
  }
\end{lstlisting}


\section{Minumum Requirements} \label{ch:minumumRequirements}

\textbf{Player} The player can control Pac-Man, and the menus, using the WASD-keys on the keyboard.

\textbf{Enemies} The computer controls the red ghost, called Blinky. Blinky is the simplest of four ghost and tries to chase Pac-Man.

\textbf{Randomness} A ghost can exist in three states; Scatter, chase and frightened. When a ghost is frightened it will pick a random direction at each intersection.

\textbf{Animation} The amount of animations in Pac-Man is limited. The animations that will be implemented are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Pac-Man's walking animation
  \item Pac-Man's death animation
  \item Ghost's movement
  \item Ghost's frightened
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Pause} The game can be paused using the "pause" or "esc" keys on the keyboard.

\textbf{Interaction with the file system} A running highscore will be kept in a file.

\section{Optional Requirements} \label{ch:optionalRequirements}

\textbf{Levels} Originally, Pac-Man only contains one level, that gets more difficult as you complete them. At least one additional level will be added as an option for the player.

\textbf{Different enemies} Pac-Man contains several ghosts. At a minimum Blinky will be implemented. Additional ghosts will be Pinky (pink), Inky (cyan) and Clyde (yellow).

\textbf{Multi-player} The original way to play against another player in Pac-Man is to beat eachother's highscore. Optionally, a way to control one of the ghosts will be added to the game.
